Since August , a shortage of funds has forced WFP to cut food assistance in half for all refugees who arrived in Uganda before July 2015 -- with the exception of particularly vulnerable groups such as orphans , the elderly , or people who are chronically ill and malnourished -- in order to prioritize food assistance for refugees who have arrived more recently . That reduction remains in place , but the UK Aid funding helps WFP avoid deeper cuts , and enables WFP to continue providing life-saving assistance for people seeking refuge in Uganda from recent conflict erupting in their home countries . This includes more than 180,000 South Sudanese refugees who have sought shelter in Uganda in the last three months . </s> No , this paragraph is not patronizing for vulnerable .
